                <h1>Why Should I Learn To Code?</h1>
                <h2>"Hey, there!"</h2>
                <p>My name is KJ Samora a.k.a. “Arizona’s Cutest Chef”.  Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.  My goal is to not only explain to you why I wish to learn how to code and how I intend to use it, but to also demonstrate my understanding of the material I was asked to study.</p>
                <h1>First, why do I want to learn to code?</h1>
                <h3>"Don't tell me what I'm going <br>to do for you, <br>tell me what you're going <br>to do for me."</h3><h3>-Chef Mules,<br>Job Interview</h3>
                <h2>"I know!  Pretty harsh, right?"</h2>
                <p>A chef once told me that during a job interview.  He had asked me why I wanted to work for him.  I immediately began to ramble off reasons I would benefit from learning from him.  I wanted to learn from the best so I could be the best.</p>
                <p>He cut me off and said, “Don’t tell me what I’m going to do for you, tell me what you’re going to do for me.”  I had not thought of it like that before.  He wanted to know how what I was going to do with what I could learn from him.  He was interested in how I would fit in as part of his team. </p>
                <p>So, I don’t want to get into how much money I can make or how I can change my life, but rather how I can be a better member of society if I can learn to code.</p>
                <h3>“When are you going to do something with your life?"<br>-My Mom<br>Disappointed phone call #52164</h3>
                <h2>Hey!  I resent that!</h2>
                <p>I’ve done a lot of things with my life!  I’ve been a Sailor, a television broadcaster, a photographer, Hot Dog Cart owner, an artist, a Chef and a bartender.  I even have an Associates Degree from Le Cordon Bleu.  It’s not that I can’t figure out what I want to do with my life, it’s that I didn’t know what I want to do existed.</p>
                <p>I've cooked for a lot of different places, both Corporate and Small Business.  I have a special place in my heart for Small Businesses.  When I work for someone who is trying to make something for themselves in this world, I try to do whatever I can to help them realize their dream.  </p>
                <h3>“I love working at the Sheridon Hotel!  They pay people to clean the kitchen at night!”
                <br>-My Roommate,
                <br>Also a Chef</h3>
                <p>Corporations usually have it figured out and they can be nice to work for if you don’t feel like taking on all the responsibility that comes with a job.  They usually have someone on the payroll or a system in place that takes care of things like payroll, inventory, hours, food-cost, etc.</p>
                <p>Most Small Businesses I’ve worked for usually have no idea how to maintain all of this at once.  Some kitchens will never run out of stuff, but you’ll never get paid on time.  Or your pay is always on time, but you never have enough inventory to cover the day.  I once worked at a place that struggled to keep the right amount of change in the register.  It wasn’t because they were struggling as a business, it’s because the owner had no system in place.  I see a lot of Owners fail because they want to do too much by themselves.  </p>
                <h2>“So, what can they do?”</h2>
                <p>There are a lot of companies that offer programs and POS systems that are available for Small Businesses.  However, they are either too broad or too narrow for what a small business needs.  I worked part time at a tattoo shop that sold jewelry.  The owner paid over $1000 (plus a monthly fee) for a POS system that was built into a register.  It took weeks to program our small inventory into it only to find out that it had no method of counting or keeping track of our inventory.  When it came down to it, she ended up paying for a very expensive itemized receipt printer.  </p>
                <p>I asked her what she wanted it to do.  Basically, she wants a system that would count every item sold as it was sold and would alert her when she was about to run out.  That’s a totally reasonable thing to want!  The math exists already, she just wanted it to be automated.</p>
                <p>I built her an excel document that does exactly what she wants, except it can’t keep track of items as they are sold and won’t alert her when inventory falls below par.</p>
                <p>When I owned my own business, Roux Gourmet Hot Dogs, I was constantly called by companies who offered to help with payroll.  The only real benefit to a company like this is they take care of your taxes for you.  This is something you might want if you are a larger business, but for a hot dog cart?  It’s just me…  I did it by myself.  It was very easy, it just takes care.</p>
                <p>So, that’s it.  Those are the two choices for Small Business owners.  An overly expensive service or system that has more bells and whistles than you need or a simple excel sheet that is very limiting.</p>
                <p>I get so mad when I think about these companies who sold my friend that POS system.  They knew it was more than she needed and in the end brought absolutely nothing new to the industry.  </p>
                <p>What I want to do is to be able to bring a sort of soft automation to small business.  I want to be able to sit down with a business owner and make them a program tailor made just for their business.  I want it to be interactive and informative.  It will teach you how to pay your taxes for the type of business you are in.  Business owners will be able to keep track of their inventory and payroll.  </p>
                <p>But, my desire to learn code doesn’t just end with helping Small Businesses succeed…  I also plan to use it with my Comedy and Art!</p>

              <section>
                <h1>That’s right!</h1>
                <p>I love to make people laugh!  It’s the one thing I take pride in in my life.  In my spare time, I like to do Stand Up.  I also express my humor thru writing, sketches, and digital art.</p>
                <p>I can see using code as another medium I can use to express my humor!</p>
                <p>I don't see why I can't incorporate technology into my acts.  I do a lot of visual bits and having imagery that can change on cue or adding a projecter could be a game changer.  I don't see a lot of comedian's doing things like that.  I think the reason for that is that usually comedians and programers don't see the value in eachother's work.</p>
                <p>I think I have a unique way of looking at the context of something that most people don't think about.  Exposing an unseen context is a great form of comedy!  Here is an example:</p>
                <p>I have a friend who smokes medicinal marijuana.  He is constantly fighting with his wife over it, not because of her feelings about using marijuana, but because of how much he spends on it. </p>
                <p>So, I wrote him an excel spreadsheet that would track how much he buys and spends.  It tells him exactly how much he spends on medical marijuana per day as well as how much he smokes.   You can see it for yourself at the link at the bottom of this section.</p>
                <p>Why did I do it?</p>
                <h2>”because it was funny!”</h2>
                <p>Don’t believe me?  Tell your coworker you spend $6.29 a day on medical marijuana and see if they don’t laugh at you…</p>
                <h3>”I spend $6.29 on medical marijuana.”<br>-You,<br>to your coworker <br>before they laugh at you.</h3>
                <p>It’s fun to organize data in a way that adds context to it.  My friend is happy to know he spends $6.29 on medical marijuana.  When we started, he was spending almost $9!</p>
                <p>You can really use this same basic structure to calculate anything.  You can see how much you spend on milk every day.  See?</p>
                <p>Here is another example:</p>
                <p>I wrote an excel spreadsheet that tracks how much I made as a bartender for over a year.  You can also check it out at the bottom of the page.</p>
                <p>What I want to draw your attention to is a little table I made that tells me how many hours I would have to work to buy something.  All I have to do is tell the table how much the purchase is and it will tell me how many weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds I have to work in order to make that purchase.  You might notice that the numbers for the days and weeks don’t add up.  That’s because I added formulas that count the average number of days I work as a week and the average number of hours I work a day as a week or day.  I usually worked 5 days a week, so a week is five days.  The information is always adjusting to the constantly incoming data.</p>
                <p>Knowing I have to work 60 hours to buy that new ipad is mind boggling!  But, knowing that I would have to work 3 or 4 weeks to get that 60 hours is important, too.  That kind of context really puts extra value on the things you work for.  </p>
                <p>How many hours do you have to work at your job just to pay your rent?</p>
                <p>I think its fun to organize data like this.  My friends say I should make an app that does some of these things.  I don’t know…  What do you think?</p>
                <p>I would also like to be able to control my web presence online.  Knowing how to code will give me an advantage to posting content, but also to protect my content!</p>
                <p>In addition, being able to help out other struggling comedians with their own web presence would be the right thing to do.  Maintaining social media can be tedious and expensive.  I would love to be able to help my friends with what I know.</p>
                <h1>I guess that’s it…</h1>
                <p>I hope I’ve been able to convey why it is I want to learn to code.  I feel there is a place for me in the world of coding and coding can give me a place in the world of what ever I choose to do.  I would love to be able to have more control and flexibility over my web presence when it comes to my comedy and art.</p>
                <h3>”Thank you!”<br>-Me,<br>To You</h3>
                <p>I want to thank you again for giving me this chance.  I know I can made a difference if I knew how to code.  I hope I had an opportunity to show what I’ve learned in the short time you’ve provided me.  The following section contains some of my art.  I hope you enjoy!</p>
